It sits behind a NAT, so I can&amp;rsquo;t connect directly to it via my public IP address. Hence, I use a cheap cloud instance on DigitalOcean to act as the gateway for my home-server to the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My &lt;a href="https://sidverma.io/2020/01/11/personal-infrastructure-overview/#how-things-actually-connect">previous setup&lt;/a> was basically a VPN tunnel between a cloud server and my home server, where the cloud server forwarded TCP traffic to my home server, which served all my services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been rebuilding this infrastructure, and one of the things I was due for, is to have all my devices (my cloud server, home server, laptop, phone, etc) connected to each other all the time. Also, it needed to be in a mesh instead of hub-and-spoke, as there was no need for data to go over the internet if I&amp;rsquo;m home, on the same physical network as my home-server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent a good amount of time trying out a bunch of methods, until settling on one. This post runs through all the options I found, and why I chose what I chose. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into how to set it up - there should be plenty of articles and documentation on the internet.
TLDR: I now use tailscale with a headscale server.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>House tour</title><link>https://sidverma.io/photos/house22/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/photos/house22/</guid><description>&lt;p>I moved into a much older house in Goa earlier this year, and had a lot of fun these past months setting it up and wiring it down.

&lt;p>Today was my first day at this stealth startup. The boss (CEO) is a dick, but we&amp;rsquo;re building great stuff. The physical entertainment/tourism industry is a huge market, and it&amp;rsquo;s very possible that we&amp;rsquo;re going to be the next Disneyworld.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tuesday">Tuesday&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Surprisingly, I feel halfway through my induction already. Things happen at such a fast pace here that it&amp;rsquo;s a bit exhilarating. Some areas definitely need much more oversight though. Just a few weeks ago, a field employee had an accident, which led to us getting sued for millions of $$. Thank fuck for insurance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In other news, I met the rest of the systems team today. I was expecting to go through some sort of imposter syndrome, working in such a lean team, but looks like that these guys aren&amp;rsquo;t that much better than me. Except for Dennis, Dennis is the &lt;em>GOAT&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="wednesday">Wednesday&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We got news that some outside &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; would be coming in over the weekend for inspection. Most likely in response to the concerns of investors and the insurance company over the lawsuit. VCs are sending this mathematician who deals with risk-prediction models (I think?). On the other hand, John, our CEO, is also bringing in some famous academics who&amp;rsquo;d likely give us the required endorsement without much fuss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Got to know more of my team today. Ray&amp;rsquo;s the cheif engineer. Good guy, heavy smoker. We really need a policy against smoking indoors here. This is not the 80s. Dennis turned out to be a bit of an ass though. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of misplaced ego in him for building the system foundation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="thursday">Thursday&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Induction got over, and today&amp;rsquo;s my first &lt;em>real&lt;/em> day at work. Now I have some clarity on how we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing things so fast. Systems seem to be well-built on the surface, but we have almost no testing protocols, no failover plans, and tons of single point of failures. And there don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a lot of access controls in place too. We have all this high-tech environment, and almost any employee can shut down the system if they know no where to do it from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the plus side, the to-do list has points listing these problems. Though it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely anyone&amp;rsquo;s getting around to those anytime soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="friday">Friday&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Today we spent most of the day preparing for the visitors tomorrow. Mostly maintenance work around the facility, tightening nuts and bolts and recalibrating power levels. Some things are buggy, but nothing deal-breaking. We&amp;rsquo;re told that John&amp;rsquo;s family is also visiting the facility this weekend, to sorta &amp;ldquo;beta-test&amp;rdquo; the rides along with the experts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="saturday">Saturday&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My shift just ended, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a smooth day so far. The family turned out to be little kids (John&amp;rsquo;s grandchildren, I assume). John insists that they are just visiting him, but I suspect he brought them in to try and butter up the experts. A lot is riding on their endorsements, and seeing kids experience the rides might give them a more positive outlook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tour had more kinks than we were expecting today. Ray&amp;rsquo;s been counting every glitch that he comes across today, and was up to 151 the last time I checked. &amp;ldquo;We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo and the computers aren&amp;rsquo;t even on their feet yet&amp;rdquo;, his exact words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be very honest, I think he gives the system way less credit than its due. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s far from perfect, but given the timeline, the company really spared no expense in building this place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sunday">Sunday&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>HOLY FUCK! &lt;strong>WHAT THE FUCK!&lt;/strong> FUUUUUCK!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this entry in the morning itself, as I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m gonna find the time again. There&amp;rsquo;s a fair chance that we&amp;rsquo;d get shut down by tomorrow, if we don&amp;rsquo;t get arrested or get eaten by a stray disnoaur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t have a complete clarity on what&amp;rsquo;s happening. Power went out in most of the park yesterday, and is still out. Cage fences aren&amp;rsquo;t working, and even the phone lines are down! Wireless seems to be fucked too because of a very coincidental storm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It appears that Dennis shut down the electrical grids yesterday and fled this island. No one knows why. We even seem to be locked out of the control systems. With no documentation, logs and system access, we&amp;rsquo;re probably not gonna be fixing this anytime soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe a complete system restart throughout the park would work. Not ideal, but if there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that anyone in the IT crowd knows - it&amp;rsquo;s that turning computers off and on again is very magical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully it works. Fuck you Dennis Nedry, and fuck you John Hammond!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website Updates</title><link>https://sidverma.io/posts/website-updates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/posts/website-updates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every once in a while, I get into this productivity slump where I don&amp;rsquo;t write code for weeks, and it gets hard to get back into the rhythm of working again.

I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time on what to write in this paragraph than the rest of this article. You&amp;rsquo;re supposed to start with a background and a motivation, and conclude with a sentence that you finally did it, and here is how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have not &lt;em>done it&lt;/em> yet. This thing keeps evolving. As to why I started doing this: it&amp;rsquo;s fun. It&amp;rsquo;s fun and powerful to be in control of where your information resides. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to build a system to manage this efficiently. There are also some benefits too: much more control over my data and the services. These are also all open-source so I can add missing features which I really really want, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to abide by the restrictive terms and limits of other platforms. And I don&amp;rsquo;t lose everything if a platform wants to shut itself down or delete my account for using their product wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iOS Shortcuts for Firefly III</title><link>https://sidverma.io/posts/firefly-iii-ios-shortcuts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/posts/firefly-iii-ios-shortcuts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the excellent &lt;a href="https://firefly-iii.org/" target="_blank">Firefly III&lt;/a> to manage my expenses for a while. As a result, I have developed a habit to actively monitor every transaction I do, which, in my opinion is a much better way than using other automated expense managers which can only track your non-cash expenses, without a lot of context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Android had an &lt;a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/xyz.hisname.fireflyiii/" target="_blank">unofficial app&lt;/a> which made it easier to interact with Firefly, but iOS doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have one, and the web-ui is not a very mobile friendly one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While searching for solutions, I came across &lt;a href="https://www.jessedyck.me/2019/03/ios-shortcuts-firefly-iii/" target="_blank">this blog post by Jesse Dyck&lt;/a> where they utilised iOS Shortcuts to create transactions in Firefly. Honestly, I was pretty surprised that Shortcuts is powerful enough to do this, given Apple&amp;rsquo;s approach to customization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shortcuts provided by Jesse didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me (they were written for iOS 12, before Shortcuts were revamped for iOS 13), so I decided to build one for myself, with a UX more suited for my needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving to an iPhone (for now)</title><link>https://sidverma.io/posts/iphone/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/posts/iphone/</guid><description>&lt;p>I spent the last two days trying to switch from my three year old Oneplus 3, to a brand new iPhone 11. I thought I was probably done with expensive phones (I count Oneplus as an expensive purchase), but resigned to giving iOS a chance this time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Oneplus has served as my phone for 33 months now, and has had its fair share of rough usage. The screen broke twice (and got replaced once). Its battery had degraded so much that I didn&amp;rsquo;t dare go out without carrying a small sling bag with a charger and a power bank in it. Screen-on time would have been somewhere between 50-90 mins. At least it charged fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fast phone by any means anymore too, and I&amp;rsquo;d gotten used to waiting a few seconds for apps to launch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The iPhone, is a stark contrast to that. It&amp;rsquo;s a recent phone with the latest and greatest Apple processor, and things are super fucking fast on it. I am almost in disbelief of how much the battery lasts on this thing. That carry bag isn&amp;rsquo;t a necessity anymore (though I have gotten used to it - it came in handy a lot more times than it became a hindrance).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backpacking 2019</title><link>https://sidverma.io/photos/backpacking19/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/photos/backpacking19/</guid><description>&lt;p>Been backpacking for a few months, while severely reducing camera time.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve self-hosted a small part of my personal infrastructure (IRC bouncer, VPN server, torrent client, etc) for a while now.
These services were set up over the course of a week on the tiniest DigitalOcean instance five years ago, never to be touched again for the next three years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two years ago, at &lt;a href="https://hackbeach.in" target="_blank">Hackbeach 2017&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aruns89" target="_blank">Arun Singh&lt;/a> gave a small talk on Infrastructure as code and &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io" target="_blank">Terraform&lt;/a>. Around then, I had recently started frequenting &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted" target="_blank">/r/selfhosted&lt;/a>, and decided to start self-hosting more of my services. Upon finally logging in into my server after three years, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand anything about the way it was set up. Port 443 seemed to be occupied by OpenVPN (for punching through restrictive firewalls), which proxied HTTP traffic to HAProxy which proxied it to a web server, and so on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ziro Festival 2019</title><link>https://sidverma.io/photos/ziro19/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/photos/ziro19/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was not planning to go to the Ziro Festival this year, but the dates coincided with a layover in Kolkata, and hence made the stop.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Russians are harvesting our faces!</title><link>https://sidverma.io/posts/faceapp-much-ado-about-nothing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/posts/faceapp-much-ado-about-nothing/</guid><description>&lt;br>

The Pi, TV and the software all get updated time to time, but the overall setup has been the same for most of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>+----+ +----+ +-----+
| TV |----(HDMI)----| Pi |--(USB/DLNA)--| HDD |
+----+ +----+ +-----+
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Controllers I&amp;rsquo;ve used for Kodi over the years -&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Desktop Keyboards (Wired/Wireless)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wireless Mouse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Web Interface&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tasker scenes utilizing the web interface API&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kodi remote apps (for Android/iOS)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emulated keyboard over SSH&lt;/li>
&lt;li>VNC&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arduino based bluetooth remote&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Game controllers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some of these were novelty ones, others were used because of circumstantial needs+availability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My primary controller is the excellent app &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree" target="_blank">Yatse&lt;/a> (Lets you browse/play media on the phone itself - much faster than the TV UI). When the phone&amp;rsquo;s not nearby, or there&amp;rsquo;s a guest involved, I use a game controller (connected for retroPie anyway).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week, I was setting up Kodi (&lt;a href="https://osmc.tv/" target="_blank">OSMC&lt;/a> to be exact) on my old roommate&amp;rsquo;s Raspberry Pi. While I was installing Yatse on his phone, this other guy present there, who isn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the software, doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any of the controller I know of, starts browsing movies on the TV. I look over, dumbfounded, and see him casually using the TV remote to play around in the UI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Five years of having a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control" target="_blank">CEC&lt;/a>-compatible TV with a CEC-compatible SBC, and it never dawned on me to try the simplest UI possible - The TV remote.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Javascript&amp;rsquo;s NPM package manager, is one of the &lt;a href="http://www.modulecounts.com/" target="_blank">biggest and fastest growing&lt;/a> package manager out there. As of writing this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RubyGems - 145,675 (25 new packages/day)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PyPI - 149,111 (104 new packages/day)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Packagist - 191,577 (103 new packages/day)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maven Central - 244,143 (149 new packages/day)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>npm - 679,009 (508 new packages/day)&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Minimalism doesn&amp;rsquo;t only apply to design, lifestyle and ownership, but also to code. Here are some of the most minimal packages in npm:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mathematical operations on objects in javascript.</title><link>https://sidverma.io/posts/javascript-mathematical-operations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/posts/javascript-mathematical-operations/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>All of these were executed on Node.js 6.9.1&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just nostalgia with rose-colored glasses. I still want to shout this here in this void.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there during the early days of internet. The first time I went online, was probably in 2005. That&amp;rsquo;s only a little over a decade, but I remember it way too differently from what it is now. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s way too&amp;hellip; homogenized is probably the right word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Chat sucks the most&lt;/strong>. Probably the worst victim of the walled-garden approach.
Things I have installed right now - Facebook messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram, Signal, Threema, Hangouts, Slack, AndroIRC, Riot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>At some point last year, I got fed up and turned off notifications for all of these except Telegram on my phone. I still keep them installed, but everything is pull-based now, when someone asks me to look at something.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not new to being on loads of platforms. A decade ago, I used to have accounts on MSN and Yahoo messenger, Google talk, (even facebook too), IRC networks, and probably a dozen I can&amp;rsquo;t remember. But at some point, I found out about XMPP and pidgin, and how open protocols are such great things. mIRC used to be the hangout app, and pidgin the IM app. Any platform, ultimately boiled down to one of these. Then, one by one, almost everyone started killing off their XMPP gateways. They cited low volume, and lack of support for their &lt;em>exciting and new features&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s always animated emojis or fucking stickers. Even slack shut down their IRC gateway earlier this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s on my To-do list to configure bitlbee and libpurple and put everything on libpurple.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Communities suck too&lt;/strong>. Everything is a facebook group and a subreddit now. Forums are ghost towns in comparison. Forums, which had basic to extremely detailed information, queries, all sorted and tagged, categorized. The forums dedicated to Lost and Doctor Who were way more fun than the show itself. You go to &lt;a href="https://reddit.com/r/startrek" target="_blank">/r/startrek&lt;/a> now, and you&amp;rsquo;re bombarded with memes, cosplay, news about the upcoming Discovery season, theories, past episode-appreciation posts, and general rants. Feel free to try to use the broken filter-by-flair. When you visited the phpBB forum for the same, there were so many subcategories, and years old active threads with lots of archived information. There&amp;rsquo;s one for artwork, one for theories, one for episode discussions, another for character discussion, another for fan-fiction. Karma fishing and reposts wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;m honestly surprised that XDA and DeviantArt, some of my oldest communities, have stuck around for so long.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And then there&amp;rsquo;re social networks&lt;/strong>. My friends, at the very least, don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;share&amp;rdquo; things online anymore. Everything is a carefully worded, edited, instagram-filtered broadcast to the world. Nothing feels personal. I had better communication with my deviantArt friends than I have with my facebook friends now. If I &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg" target="_blank">unblock my facebook news feed&lt;/a> right now, this is what I see: Random selfie #9 this week, anti-Trump news, anti-BJP news, anti-BJP posts, rants against patriarchy. Once in a while I find out something interesting about poeple: a new relationship, a new job, a new city. But everything else is just people shouting the same thing in an echo chamber. Or else, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot of self-promotion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember this being way different in 2010: There was a group for post-class hangout, another for books present in our library, and countless others. News feed used to be people sharing opinions without fear, and way less fishing for &amp;lsquo;likes&amp;rsquo;. People planned things using their status. Comments were more conversational than &amp;lsquo;👍🏼&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;nice pic.'. All the things I despise right now did exist then, but in a far lesser amount.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I dread the day when &lt;a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/dw2rwy1/?context=3" target="_blank">reddit finally turns into a social network&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I also miss RSS&lt;/strong>. Nowadays, my RSS feed is just news and comics. At some point, people used to have blogspot and wordpress accounts, where they tagged posts. I subscribed to the &amp;lsquo;travel&amp;rsquo; feed for someone, &amp;lsquo;personal&amp;rsquo; of someone else, &amp;lsquo;essays&amp;rsquo; of the other. Now everything is just there, flat on Facebook/Twitter. Even they used to offer RSS feeds, which they phased out. Fucking twitter, where you get just one feed, with people sharing memes, jokes, news, achievements, all floating in the same cesspool of diarrhea, just begging for retweets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dumb smartphone is the best smartphone.</title><link>https://sidverma.io/posts/dumb-smartphone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/posts/dumb-smartphone/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quick recap: I dropped my Oneplus 3 six months ago - didn&amp;rsquo;t get it repaired for a month.

&lt;p>hillhacks is held in the lap of the stunning Dhauladhar Himalayas every summer.&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People from different places, walks of life and lines of thought come together to share, collaborate and learn.&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hackers talk code. Artists share their creativity. Students join in from schools and colleges to learn new skills. Locals and globals mix and mingle. We build things like tables, hula hoops, interactive art installations, and solar lanterns. We connect. We dance and sing. Ideas emerge. Collaborations form. Lives change.&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the hacking, we get hacked ourselves.&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Hackbeach is the sister event of hillhacks, held in the winters, on one of India&amp;rsquo;s coast.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>DO NOT use &lt;code>&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code> or &lt;code>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags and then proceed to handle their &lt;code>click&lt;/code> events. Use proper &lt;code>&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags. This breaks so many things!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>People can&amp;rsquo;t use them if they have disabled javascript or it just failed to load.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ctrl-click will not open a new tab unless you explicitly handle the situation. (More on that below)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even then, you just dumbed down your users&amp;rsquo; context menus. No &lt;em>Open link in new tab&lt;/em>, or &lt;em>Copy link address&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The same situation on mobile. Long click will copy the text instead of showing helpful actions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The javascript might break, throw an unexpected error, or burn down your house, rendering that &amp;ldquo;link&amp;rdquo; useless.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Even when you are using &lt;code>&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tags:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If possible, execute whatever JS you want, and then let the link do its job. Don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;code>preventDefault()&lt;/code> and open the link through javascript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you really have to open it through JS, take care of Ctrl-clicks. And Cmd-clicks in case of macOs. &lt;a href="http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html" target="_blank">Old browsers might make this difficult&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Put &lt;code>mailto:&lt;/code> links only where the email-id is the visible text too. &lt;a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com&lt;/a> is so much better than &lt;a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">Contact Email&lt;/a>. Not everyone has email clients configured, and opening bulky clients when clicking a link is just bad UX. Or people might just want to note down the address, to contact later.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Wi-Fi positioning woes</title><link>https://sidverma.io/posts/wifi-positioning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/posts/wifi-positioning/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alice lives in India. She has super-cheap cellular internet (less than $0.2/GB on some networks). Cheap enough for it to be her daily driver, using &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.in/D-Link-DWR-720-HSPA-Mobile-Router/dp/B00PVD1RV2" target="_blank">a&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hotspot-Unlocked-Worldwide-Huawei-E5220s-6/dp/B06XJ5NF8W/" target="_blank">number&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Verizon-Wireless-LTE-Prepaid-Smartphone/dp/B014RJJXUW/" target="_blank">of&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hotspot-Unlocked-MF65-Router-Mobile/dp/B01KGCMUQ8/" target="_blank">portable&lt;/a> Wi-Fi routers, which just sit on her desk. And since it is so cheap and portable and convenient and long-lasting, she just carries it everywhere in her purse, wherever she travels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alice also faces an a peculiar amount of problems with her GPS. She could be at a crowded bus station, trying to get an Uber, or stuck in a storm, again trying to get a cab, her phone just fails to locate her correctly long enough for the app to work. Either it&amp;rsquo;ll just be showing her previous location at the far away house, or it will keep fluctuating and jumping between her actual position, and her house. People around her sometimes get affected too. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a curse.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hillhacks 2017</title><link>https://sidverma.io/photos/hillhacks17/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/photos/hillhacks17/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some Hillhacks 2017 photos and even more from a stop at Dharamshala and some hills.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>STDIN inputs via Sublime Text (sort of)</title><link>https://sidverma.io/posts/sublime-input/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sidverma.io/posts/sublime-input/</guid><description>&lt;p>I love Sublime Text. I really do. I can put a ring on it if it had any corporeal form. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it so much, that trying to work on anything else is kind of a pain. And yet, when dealing with STDIN inputs, the magic falters. This method describes a workaround to give inputs without a prompt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I tried my hand on Competitive Programming, and though I didn&amp;rsquo;t get really good at it, I did encounter a frustation. Entering the same input again and again after every change I make to the code. I wanted a simpler method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what a friend of mine came up with: Enter the input in comments.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span class="cm">/*input
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cm">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cm">foo
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cm">bar
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cm">*/&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="cp">#include&lt;/span> &lt;span class="cpf">&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cp">
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cp">&lt;/span>&lt;span class="kt">int&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nf">main&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">()&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">{&lt;/span>

&lt;span class="kt">char&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">s&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">[&lt;/span>&lt;span class="mi">10&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">];&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="n">scanf&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;%d&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">,&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">&amp;amp;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">n&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">);&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="k">for&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">i&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="mi">0&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">i&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">n&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">i&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">++&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">{&lt;/span>
