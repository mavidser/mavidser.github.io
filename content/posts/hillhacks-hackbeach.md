Hillhacks, [as defined by the website][hillhacks]:
> hillhacks is held in the lap of the stunning Dhauladhar Himalayas every summer.<br>
>
> People from different places, walks of life and lines of thought come together to share, collaborate and learn.<br>
>
> Hackers talk code. Artists share their creativity. Students join in from schools and colleges to learn new skills. Locals and globals mix and mingle. We build things like tables, hula hoops, interactive art installations, and solar lanterns. We connect. We dance and sing. Ideas emerge. Collaborations form. Lives change.<br>
>
> In the hacking, we get hacked ourselves.<br>
