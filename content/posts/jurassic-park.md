  #### Monday

  Today was my first day at this stealth startup. Boss (the CEO) is a dick, but we're building great stuff. The physical entertainment/tourism industry is a huge market, and it's very possible that we're going to be the next Disneyworld.

  #### Tuesday

  Surprisingly, I feel halfway through my induction already. Things happen at such a fast pace here that it's a bit exhilarating. Some areas definitely need much more oversight though. Just a few weeks ago, a field employee went through an accident and we got sued for millions of $$. Investors are pissed, and even our insurance company is skeptical of our safety standards.

  In other news, I met the rest of the systems team today. I was expecting to go through some sort of imposter syndrome, working in such a lean team, but looks like that these guys aren't that much better than me. Except for Dennis, Dennis is the _GOAT_!

  #### Wednesday

  We got news that some outside "experts" would be coming in on the weekend for inspection. The VC's lawyer is bringing this mathematician who deals with prediction models. John, the CEO, has some connect with famous academics who should be giving us the go-ahead without much ado.

  We had a small mid-week party today, and got to know more of my colleagues. Ray is our chief engineer, and a pretty good one. Does smoke a lot though, without caring who he's blowing smoke on, even after subtly mentioning it three times. I feel a bit conflicted about Dennis. He's surely smarter than the rest, but also an asshole. Keeps on boasting how he's singlehandedly building this system, and how little he's being paid for the work. Thankfully, Ray knows how to put him back in his place.

  #### Thursday

  Induction got over, and today's my first _real_ day at work. Now I have some clarity on how we've been doing things so fast. Systems seem to be well-built on the surface, but we have almost no testing protocols, no failover plans, and tons of single point of failures. And there don't seem to be a lot of access controls in place too. We have all this high-tech environment, and almost any employee can shut down the system if they know no where to do it from.

  But on the plus side, the company seems to be aware of these problems, and has a rough plan to fix this in the near future.

  #### Friday

  Today we spent most of the day preparing for the visitors tomorrow. Mostly maintenance work around the facility, tightening nuts and bolts and recalibrating power levels. Some things are buggy, but nothing deal-breaking. We're told that the John's family is also visiting the facility this weekend, to sorta "beta-test" the rides along with the experts.

  #### Saturday

  My shift just ended, and it's been a smooth day so far. John's family turned out to be little kids (his grandchildren, I assume) which threw me off a bit. He insists that they are very smart for their age. I wish my parents were this cool. My mom just used to berate me in-front of everyone.

  The tour had more kinks than we were expecting today. Ray's been counting every glitch that he comes across today, and was up to 151 the last time I checked. "We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo and the computers aren't even on their feet yet", he claims.

  To be fair, I think he under-appreciates how automated this place is. Processes and management might be shit, but the company really spared no expense in the level of advanced technology we employ.

  #### Sunday

  HOLY FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK. FUUUUUCK!

  I'm writing this entry in the morning itself, as I'm not sure if I'm gonna find time again. I have a feeling we might be shut down by tomorrow, if we don't get arrested or get eaten by one of these dinosaurs running amok.

  We don't have a complete clarity on what's happening. Power went out in most of the park yesterday, and is still out. Cage fences aren't working, and even the phone lines are down! Wireless seems to be fucked too because of a very coincidental storm.

  It appears that Dennis shut down the electrical grids yesterday and fled this island. No one knows why. We even seem to be locked out of the control systems. With no documentation, logs and system access, we're probably not gonna be fixing this anytime soon.

  Maybe a complete system restart throughout the park would work. Not ideal, but if there's one thing that anyone in the IT crowd knows - it's that turning computers off and on again is very magical.

  Hopefully it works. Fuck you Dennis Nedry, and fuck you John Hammond!
