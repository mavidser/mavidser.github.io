I'm hoping to write a blog series for my younger self. He is someone who used to look at a service and say - "I could build that over a weekend". This is also someone who would look at a company with a small product, which rarely gets any new features, and wonder why that product needs 10 developers working fulltime on it.

I don't plan on writing about the philosophical aspects of those questions. Maybe the weekend hack _would_ come out better. Maybe that company _is_ bad at resource utilization. Maybe capitalism _is_ the root of all evil. I am taking the current state and processes at face value, and try to commentate on how and why this usually comes to be.

I hope that these posts don't require a lot of technical knowledge, and are easily readable by beginners, or maybe non-technical folk.
