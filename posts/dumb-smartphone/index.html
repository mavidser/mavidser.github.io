Instead, carried this $10 phone with me for a while.</p><figure><img src=/images/dumbphone.jpg alt="My interimn phone"><figcaption><p>My interimn phone</p></figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, I did go back to the smartphone - to order cabs, read important emails, and take photographs.</p><p>But this really made me miss the bliss of not owning a smartphone. In the previous month, I used to look at the tiny screen for a maximum of 5 minutes every day. Now when I&rsquo;m back on the smartphone, the screen-time is also back to a few hours - Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook, Kindle, Google Chrome.</p><p>Also came with it, a lot of micro-interruptions throughout the day in the form of notifications - IMs, promotions, emails, etc. An average of 15 notifications every day.</p><p>I have read accounts of people who don&rsquo;t use a smartphone, or even a phone anymore. Unfortunately, that is not the way for me, at least right now. I recognize, and enjoy some of the features my Android phone gives me. I have a relatively short memory, and a notes app is essential to my life. I can&rsquo;t drive, so I usually move around by walking, or through Uber. Also, I like charting the sky with the help of Stellarium.</p><h2 id=solutions>Solutions</h2><ul><li><p>Uninstall social networks. Except for Instagram, which I post on once a few weeks - all social networks were uninstalled. Those which were not installed, were removed from the homescreen at the very least.</p></li><li><p>Next, remove the browser from the homescreen itself.</p></li></ul><figure><img src=/images/phone-homescreens.jpg alt="Phone homescreens - then and now"><figcaption><p>Phone homescreens - then and now</p></figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>Disable notifications for all of the IM apps I use - SMS, Telegram, Whatsapp, Signal, Messenger, Hangouts, Personal E-mail.
This changed my consumption of messages from a push-based mechanism to a pull-based. Emails are checked every morning and evening. If any IM is important, people would find an alternate way to reach me, or just call me.</p></li><li><p>Over the next few days, continue to disable notifications for any app which ever sent a promotional notification - Amazon, Google maps, Flipkart, Myntra, Amazon Go, Grofers, Uber, Ola, Bookmyshow&mldr;</p></li><li><p>Start wearing a watch - I compulsively check the time whenever I get the chance to. This stops me from taking the phone out when I&rsquo;m away from the computer.</p></li></ul><h2 id=status-now>Status, now.</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been using this setup for the past 6 months now. On an average, I stare at my phone for 15-45 minutes every day. 10 of those minutes would be on the shitter, where I am browsing reddit.com, and the 30 could be in commute, where I&rsquo;d read some book or comic, or just listen to a podcast.</p><p>The only notifications I&rsquo;ve received in the past 6 months are work emails, meeting reminders, and reminders which I set myself. Every other weekend or so, I&rsquo;d check one of the IM apps and see if I missed anything important. Luckily, nothing as of yet.</p><p>I chat with people over slack and facebook messenger - exclusively on the desktop.</p><p>If I do need to check a social post some people are talking about, I open the browser after and check it out there.</p><p>My browser habits have changed too - I&rsquo;ve stopped using tabs on phone. As a heavy tab user, this limit on multitasking really makes me not use the browser anymore than absolutely necessary.</p><figure><img src=/images/689-tabs-closed.jpg></figure></article><br><div class=tags><div class="horizontal-links links"><a href=/tags/tech/>#tech</a></div></div></article></main><footer><div class=content-container><div class=content><p>Hey friend.
